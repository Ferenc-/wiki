Filters are used for filtering out videos of your feed.
If a video matches any of the filters, it will not show in your feed.
A video matches the filter if the title contains the character-sequence of the title filter and the 
creator contains the character-sequence of the creator filter.
The filter can contain any regular expression, so you can make your filter as complex as you want.
