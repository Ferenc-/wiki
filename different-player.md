# Using a different video player

__Note__: Depending on the video player you use, you may not be able to play videos from all supported platforms.

# Using the settings

Just change the value of the "Player"-field in the settings. This value could e.g. be `mpv` or `com.github.rafostar.Clapper`.

# Using environmental variables

__Note__: This overrides any values in the settings.

To change the default video player, use the environmental variable `PLAYER`. You can for example set this variable in your `.profile`, e.g
by adding `PLAYER="myplayer"` to your `.profile`. This will disable the setting for changing the player.
